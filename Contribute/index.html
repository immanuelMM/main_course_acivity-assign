        <h1>Birth of the Public Service Channel</h1>
        <p>In 2004, Kuya Daniel captained the launch of UNTV through Breakthrough and Milestones Productions International (BMPI). As BMPI CEO, the veteran broadcast journalist pioneered the production of quality content and launch of groundbreaking and innovative programs and public service projects.
